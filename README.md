# Strangiato
A proof-of-concept virus that I created for my COMP-3-247 - Advanced Investigations class

# Background Information
COMP-3-247 consisted of learning various security practices for mitigating malicious threats, more specifically, different types of malware. For the fourth lab of the class, we were instructed with not only generating a backdoor trojan using MSFVenom, but we were also tasked to create some malware of our own. We could have used Metasploit for both tasks, though I decided to go for the difficult route because I'm a masochistic psychopath
